## Financial Impact Patterns

### January 10, 2025
Children's health insurance lapsed. Received notice from provider that Marcus stopped paying premiums in November. Per court order, he is responsible for maintaining coverage. Lily has asthma and needs regular medication. Had to pay $340 out of pocket for inhaler.

### December 5, 2024
Marcus did not contribute to agreed-upon holiday gift budget. Children received significantly fewer gifts at his house. Aiden said "Dad says he can't afford presents because of what he pays you." Court-ordered support is $1,200/month.

### October 18, 2024
Aiden needed glasses. Optometrist visit and frames cost $425. Marcus refused to split cost saying "You make more than me now." Paid full amount to ensure Aiden could see in class.

### September 2, 2024
School supplies list totaled $180 for both kids. Marcus did not respond to text asking to split. Paid in full. Marcus later complained children "only brought supplies from your house."

### July 15, 2024
Summer camp fee was $600 per child. Marcus agreed via text to pay half. Payment deadline passed, he had not paid. Camp threatened to drop children's enrollment. Paid his half to keep spots.

### May 28, 2024
Lily's dance recital costume was $95. Marcus said he "didn't agree to dance" so wouldn't pay. Lily has been in dance for 3 years. He has attended recitals.

### March 3, 2024
Children's dentist sent bill to collections. Marcus was supposed to pay this visit (we alternate). He claimed he "never got the bill." Collections impacted my credit score since children are on my insurance.

### December 20, 2023
Marcus gave each child $5 for their class gift exchange. Limit was $15. Aiden said he felt "embarrassed" because his gift was "the smallest one."

### August 8, 2023
Marcus canceled children's phone plan (shared family plan) without notice. I found out when Aiden couldn't reach me during Marcus's parenting time. Marcus said "They don't need phones, they're kids."

### April 15, 2023
Tax refund dispute. Marcus claimed both children on his taxes despite agreement to alternate years. IRS rejected my return. Had to amend and lost $2,400 in credits.

## Parentification

### January 18, 2025
Lily (10 years old) told me she "takes care of Dad when he's sad." When I asked what that meant, she said "I make him tea and tell him everything will be okay and sometimes I rub his back when he cries about you."

### December 28, 2024
Children returned from holiday visit. Aiden said he "made Christmas dinner" because "Dad didn't feel like cooking." Aiden is 10. He described making frozen pizza and heating canned vegetables for himself and Lily.

### November 10, 2024
Lily mentioned she "helps Dad pay bills online" because "he gets confused by the computer." She said she types in the numbers from his checkbook while he tells her what to write.

### September 22, 2024
Aiden said he "stayed home from Dad's friend's party" to "watch Lily" because Dad "needed a break." Children were alone at Marcus's house for approximately 4 hours. They are 10.

### August 3, 2024
Lily told her therapist (Dr. Chen) she feels responsible for "making Dad happy" and worries about him "all the time" when she's at my house. Therapist flagged this as parentification concern.

### June 14, 2024
Children said they "cleaned the whole house" at Dad's because "it was really messy and Dad was too tired." Aiden described doing laundry, dishes, and vacuuming while Marcus "watched TV."

### April 5, 2024
Aiden asked me for advice on "how to make Dad feel better about the divorce." He said "Dad tells me I'm the man of the house now and I need to help him." Aiden is 10 years old.

### February 18, 2024
Lily said she "wakes Dad up for work" because "his alarm doesn't work." She said if she doesn't wake him, "he gets in trouble at his job." She sets her own alarm for 5:30 AM to do this.

### November 5, 2023
Aiden came home exhausted. Said he "stayed up late talking to Dad about grown-up stuff." When asked, he said Dad tells him about "money problems and lawyer stuff and how hard everything is."

### July 22, 2023
Children returned from two-week summer visit. Both had lost weight. Lily said they "ate a lot of cereal" because "Dad forgot to go to the store." Aiden said he tried to make them eggs but "burned them."

### April 30, 2023
Lily told me "Dad says I'm his best friend." She said she feels "bad" when she has fun at my house because "Dad is alone."

## Distorted Narratives

### January 5, 2025
Aiden repeated: "Dad says you left him for another man." This is not true. I filed for divorce after Marcus's alcohol issues escalated. There was no other person involved. Court records document the actual reason.

### November 22, 2024
Marcus told children I "took all his money in the divorce." Actual settlement was 50/50 split of marital assets. Children asked why I "stole from Dad."

### September 8, 2024
Lily came home saying "Dad said you didn't want custody of us at first." This is completely false. I requested primary custody from the beginning. Court records confirm this.

### July 1, 2024
Marcus told children our house "used to be his house" and I "kicked him out." We sold the marital home and I purchased a new home independently. He has never lived at this address.

### May 15, 2024
Aiden said "Dad showed me a video of you yelling at him." Asked what video, Aiden described an argument from 2022. Marcus had recorded me without consent during a disagreement about his drinking and showed it to a 10-year-old.

### February 28, 2024
Children said Dad told them "Mom's lawyer is lying to the judge." They asked me "Why is your lawyer a liar?"

### October 10, 2023
Marcus told children that the reason he sees them less is because "Mom won't let me." Current custody schedule was ordered by the court after evaluation due to concerns about his home stability. I have never denied his parenting time.

### June 6, 2023
Lily repeated "Dad says you ruined his life." She asked me if that was true. She was crying.

## Medical/Therapeutic Interference

### December 12, 2024

### August 20, 2024
Lily's asthma flared at Marcus's house. He did not have her inhaler there despite multiple requests. She was taken to urgent care. Marcus said he "didn't think she needed it."

### May 5, 2024
Aiden was prescribed ADHD medication after evaluation. Marcus refuses to give it during his parenting time saying "He doesn't need drugs, he just needs discipline." School reports significant behavior difference between weeks.

### March 18, 2024
Marcus pulled children from therapy session mid-appointment. Dr. Chen called to inform me. Marcus told therapist the children "don't need to talk to strangers about family business."

### September 15, 2023
Lily had ear infection. I sent antibiotics with written instructions to Marcus. Medication came back nearly full after his parenting time. Lily's infection worsened and required stronger medication.
