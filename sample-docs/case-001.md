## Medical Communication Issues

### October 15, 2025
Received call from Ethan's pediatrician office. They needed consent for flu shot but couldn't reach Michael. Office said they've called his listed number 3 times over past week with no response. Had to delay vaccination appointment.

### August 3, 2025
Ethan mentioned during pickup that he has been complaining of stomach pain for "a few days." Michael did not inform me of any symptoms. When I texted to ask about it, Michael responded 6 hours later: "It's handled."

### March 12, 2025
School nurse called me at work. Ethan fell on playground and bumped his head. Nurse said she tried calling Michael first (listed as primary contact) but got voicemail. She called me as secondary contact. I left work to pick him up. Michael texted me 3 hours later asking why I picked Ethan up early.

## Schedule and Transition Issues

### September 28, 2025
Michael was supposed to drop Ethan off at 6:00 PM Sunday per parenting plan. He texted at 5:45 PM: "Running late, be there by 7:30." Arrived at 8:15 PM. Ethan had school next morning and had not eaten dinner yet.

### July 4, 2025
Holiday weekend - my scheduled parenting time per calendar. Michael texted July 3rd at 9 PM saying he "already made plans" to take Ethan camping and that I "wouldn't mind switching." I had already taken time off work and planned activities.

### April 19, 2025
Picked up Ethan for my parenting time. He did not have his backpack with homework that's due Monday. Michael said "He didn't tell me he needed it." Ethan is 8 years old.

## Communication Pattern

### October 8, 2025
Sent Michael message asking about Ethan's soccer schedule (he signed him up without discussing). No response. Sent follow-up message 3 days later. No response. Found out from another parent that practices are Tuesdays and Thursdays at 5 PM - conflicts with my parenting time.

### June 15, 2025
Ethan told me he needs $40 for field trip permission slip by Friday. I texted Michael asking if he received the form and whether we should split the cost. Read receipt shows message was read. No response for 5 days. Paid full amount to ensure Ethan could attend.

## Boundary Issues

### May 2, 2025
Dropped Ethan off at Michael's house for his parenting time. Michael's girlfriend answered the door. She introduced herself as "Jessica" and said Michael "had to run an errand but would be back soon." This was the first time I had heard of a girlfriend. Ethan appeared to already know her well.

### February 20, 2025
Ethan mentioned during bedtime that he "likes his new room at Dad's house." I was not aware Michael had moved. Address on parenting plan is different address. When I asked Michael about it, he said "I moved in December. Didn't think I needed to tell you."

### November 12, 2024
During pickup, Ethan said: "Dad says I don't have to listen to you when I'm at your house because you're not the boss of him."
