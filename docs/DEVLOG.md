# DEVLOG - North Star for High-Conflict Cases

## Project Overview
**Hackathon:** Dynamous & Kiro ($17K prize pool)  
**Deadline:** January 23, 2025, 11:59 PM PST  
**Start Date:** January 12, 2025

---

## Day 1 — Monday, January 12 (12:00 PM – 3:00 PM)

### Focus: Project Setup & Strategic Foundation

**Hours:** 3

#### What I Did
- Reviewed hackathon requirements and scoring rubric (40 pts application, 20 pts Kiro usage, 20 pts documentation, 15 pts innovation, 5 pts presentation)
- Analyzed template repo at github.com/coleam00/dynamous-kiro-hackathon
- Started Kiro configuration and project scaffold
- Began drafting steering documents

#### Key Decisions
- **CLI-first architecture** — Build core analysis as command-line tool, optional UI wrapper only if time permits
- **Single-document scope** — Process one document per run, not batch processing
- **Local-only execution** — No external APIs, databases, accounts, or cloud services

#### Blockers / Open Questions
- Still working through exact output format
- Need to define what "patterns" means in this context
- Kiro prompt structure not yet finalized

## Day 2 — Tuesday, January 13 (Full Day)

### Focus: MVP Scope Lock & Architecture Clarification

**Hours:** ~8

#### What I Did
- Extensive strategy session to lock MVP scope
- Defined product name: **North Star for High-Conflict Cases**
- Established output model (pattern-first approach)
- Clarified critical architecture decision: pattern *mapping*, not pattern *discovery*
- Created steering documents:
  - `product.md` — Product overview, users, features, constraints
  - `tech.md` — Technical architecture, stack, standards
  - `structure.md` — Directory layout, module organization
  - `agent.json` — North-star-analyst agent definition

#### Key Decisions

**Product Positioning:**
> CLI-first tool that helps parents translate overwhelming documentation into clear, restrained, child-centered summaries for professionals in high-conflict custody cases.

**Output Model — Pattern-First (3×3):**
- Up to 3 core patterns related to child impact
- Each pattern supported by up to 3 concrete, fact-only instances
- Yields 8-10 total examples (balances completeness with credibility)
- Patterns explain relevance; instances provide evidence

**Three Generated Files:**
1. **Attorney-Ready Summary** — Facts only, neutral, ranked, no emotion/diagnosis/advice
2. **GAL/Clinician Summary** — Child-impact framing, pattern + context, factual/neutral
3. **Internal Clarity View** — Why examples prioritized, how patterns informed selection

**Architecture Clarification (Critical):**
System does NOT "discover" patterns. System *maps* factual instances from user document to predefined, non-authoritative forensic pattern framework already used in family law/custody evaluation contexts.

Process:
1. Extract factual statements from document
2. Compare facts against documented pattern definitions
3. Group repeated, fact-supported instances under predefined categories

This reduces risk significantly vs. pattern discovery. System does not invent, infer, diagnose, label, or conclude.

**Safety Boundaries (Enforced):**
- No legal advice, filing guidance, motion strategy
- No diagnosis or statutory interpretation
- Perspective-based analysis only — no authoritative voice
- Explicit disclaimers in all outputs and README

#### Tradeoffs Considered
- **Volume vs. credibility:** Chose fewer stronger examples over comprehensive extraction. Professionals dismiss volume; they trust restraint.
- **Pattern discovery vs. mapping:** Rejected AI-generated pattern labels in favor of mapping to established frameworks. Safer, more defensible.
- **Multi-document vs. single-document:** Deferred multi-document to post-MVP. Single document keeps scope tight.

#### Blockers Resolved
- ✅ Output format locked (3 files, pattern-first structure)
- ✅ "Pattern" definition clarified (mapping to predefined taxonomy, not discovery)
- ✅ Safety boundaries explicit and enforceable

#### Still Open
- Pattern taxonomy source file not yet populated
- Kiro prompts not yet written
- CLI pipeline not yet implemented

## Day 3 — Wednesday, January 14 (7:00 AM – 11:45 AM, 2:00 PM – ongoing)

### Focus: Tool Migration & Build Resume

**Hours:** 4.75 + ongoing

#### What I Did (Morning)
- Continued strategy refinement
- Reviewed implementation status against 8-day plan
- Reality check: strategic foundation strong, but no working code yet

#### Key Realization
ChatGPT effective for strategy work but hitting limits for implementation. Made decision to migrate to Claude for execution phase.

**Migration rationale:**
- Claude's computer use / file creation capabilities better suited for actually building
- Need to generate real files, not just discuss them
- Strategy complete; execution is the bottleneck

#### What I'm Doing (Afternoon)
- [x] Created DEVLOG.md (this file)
- [ ] Populate pattern taxonomy (`reference/child-impact-patterns.md`)
- [ ] Build first Kiro prompt (fact extraction)
- [ ] Implement CLI pipeline foundation

#### Current Status
| Component | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| Strategic foundation | ✅ Complete |
| Steering docs | ✅ Complete |
| DEVLOG | ✅ Created |
| Pattern taxonomy | ❌ Not started |
| Kiro prompts | ❌ Not started |
| CLI pipeline | ❌ Not started |
| README | ❌ Not started |
| Test outputs | ❌ Not started |

#### Timeline Assessment
Day 3 of 8. Behind on implementation but strategic foundation is solid. Must execute now.

**Remaining days:**
- Day 4-5: Core pipeline (pattern detection, perspective lenses, output generation)
- Day 6: Documentation, demo prep, UI gate decision
- Day 7: Optional UI (only if Day 6 gate passes)
- Day 8: Buffer, submission prep

## Decision Log

| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| Jan 12 | CLI-first architecture | Simpler, faster to build, UI optional |
| Jan 13 | Pattern mapping (not discovery) | Reduces risk, maps to established frameworks |
| Jan 13 | 3×3 output model | Balances completeness with credibility |
| Jan 13 | Three output files | Different professional audiences need different framing |
| Jan 14 | Migrate to Claude for build | Better tooling for file generation and execution |

## Notes for Judges

This DEVLOG is maintained in real-time during development. It documents:
- Actual time invested
- Key decisions and their rationale
- Tradeoffs considered and rejected
- Honest status of implementation progress

The strategic foundation (Days 1-2) was deliberately front-loaded. The product addresses a real problem space where AI tools have significant potential for harm if built carelessly. Time spent on constraints, safety boundaries, and scope discipline is not wasted—it's essential.
