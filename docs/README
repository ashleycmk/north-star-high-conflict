# North Star for High-Conflict Cases

A CLI-first tool that helps parents translate overwhelming documentation into clear, restrained, child-centered summaries for professionals in high-conflict custody cases.

## The Problem

Parents in high-conflict custody cases often accumulate extensive documentation—incident logs, communication records, behavioral observations. This documentation is critical but frequently:

- Overwhelms professionals (attorneys, GALs, clinicians) with volume
- Contains emotional language that triggers bias or dismissal
- Buries the most relevant child-impact evidence in narrative

Professionals need signal, not noise. Parents need their documentation to be heard.

## What This Tool Does

North Star processes a single document and produces three professionally-focused outputs:

| Output | Audience | Focus |
|--------|----------|-------|
| **Attorney-Ready Summary** | Legal counsel | Facts only, neutral language, ranked by relevance |
| **GAL/Clinician Summary** | Evaluators, therapists | Child-impact framing, behavioral patterns |
| **Internal Clarity View** | Parent (private) | Transparency on prioritization decisions |

### Core Approach

- **Pattern mapping, not discovery** — Maps facts to established forensic frameworks, doesn't invent labels
- **Restraint over volume** — Surfaces 8-10 strongest examples, not everything
- **Child-centered prioritization** — Ranks by impact on children, not parental grievance
- **Emotion separation** — Preserves emotional content separately, excludes from professional outputs

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Kiro CLI installed and authenticated

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ashleycmk/north-star-high-conflict.git
cd north-star-high-conflict

# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

```bash
# Start the application
python ui/app.py
```

Then open your browser to `http://localhost:5000`

1. Upload your document (plain text or markdown)
2. Click "Analyze"
3. View and download your three summary outputs

## ⚠️ Important Disclaimers

**This tool does NOT provide:**
- Legal advice or case strategy
- Diagnostic conclusions
- Filing guidance or motion recommendations
- Professional judgment substitution

**This tool is NOT:**
- A replacement for legal counsel
- A clinical assessment tool
- An authoritative voice on custody matters

**All outputs require professional review.** This tool helps organize and translate documentation—it does not evaluate cases or make recommendations.

## How It Works

1. **Fact Extraction** — Separates factual statements from emotional language
2. **Pattern Mapping** — Maps facts to predefined child-impact pattern categories
3. **Relevance Analysis** — Weighs patterns across attorney/GAL/clinician perspectives
4. **Output Generation** — Produces audience-appropriate summaries

See [docs/DEVLOG.md](docs/DEVLOG.md) for detailed development decisions.
