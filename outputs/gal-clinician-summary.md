## Pattern 1: Parentification & Role Reversal
**Priority:** High  
**Incidents:** 11

### Behavioral Context
Two 10-year-old children have assumed extensive emotional and practical caregiving responsibilities for their father, including emotional regulation support, household management, and adult companionship roles.

### Documented Child Impact
- Therapist (Dr. Chen) identified parentification concerns: Lily feels responsible for "making Dad happy" and experiences chronic worry
- Child statement: "I don't want to go to Dad's because he's sad all the time and I have to take care of him and I'm tired"
- Child emotional burden: "I try really hard to make Dad happy but nothing works. I think something is wrong with me"
- Loss of childhood activities replaced by adult responsibilities (cooking, cleaning, bill management, emotional support)

### Relevant Observations
- Children provide emotional comfort during father's distress (making tea, back rubs during crying episodes)
- Children assume household management (cleaning, laundry, meal preparation) while father remains passive
- Children left unsupervised for extended periods to accommodate father's social activities

## Pattern 2: Medical/Therapeutic Interference
**Priority:** High  
**Incidents:** 5

### Behavioral Context
Pattern of treatment non-compliance and therapeutic disruption affecting children's medical and mental health care continuity.

### Documented Child Impact
- Asthma episode requiring urgent care due to medication unavailability
- ADHD medication inconsistency creating behavioral instability documented by school
- Therapeutic progress disrupted by missed appointments and mid-session removal
- Children's health insurance lapsed, creating treatment access barriers

### Relevant Observations
- Three missed therapy appointments in 2024 during father's parenting time
- Medication non-compliance attributed to parental philosophy rather than child's medical needs
- Therapeutic relationship undermined by characterization of treatment as inappropriate "stranger" involvement

## Pattern 3: Financial Impact on Child
**Priority:** High  
**Incidents:** 10

### Behavioral Context
Children exposed to adult financial disputes and made aware of economic conflicts between parents, creating inappropriate financial anxiety and guilt.

### Documented Child Impact
- Child reported embarrassment about inadequate gift due to stated financial constraints
- Children question mother's financial honesty based on father's statements about "hidden money"
- Health needs unmet due to financial non-compliance (insurance lapse, unpaid medical bills)
- Children witness disparity in financial provision between households

### Relevant Observations
- Children receive explanations for limitations that reference child support payments
- Educational and extracurricular needs unmet due to cost-sharing disputes
- Children's understanding of family finances inappropriate for developmental stage
