## Pattern 1: Parentification & Role Reversal
**Priority:** High
**Incidents:** 11

### Behavioral Context
Children ages 10 are assuming adult emotional and practical responsibilities including emotional caregiving for parent, household management, and financial assistance beyond age-appropriate level.

### Documented Child Impact
C2 (Lily) reports feeling responsible for P2 (Marcus)'s emotional wellbeing and worrying about him constantly when not present. Professional documentation from Dr. Chen specifically flagged parentification concerns. Children demonstrate anxiety about parent's functioning and have assumed caretaking roles including meal preparation, household cleaning, and emotional support.

### Relevant Observations
- C2 (Lily) sets alarm for 5:30 AM to wake P2 (Marcus) for work, stating if she doesn't, "he gets in trouble at his job"
- Both children lost weight during two-week visit, reporting they "ate a lot of cereal" because P2 (Marcus) "forgot to go to the store"
- C1 (Aiden) reports staying up late discussing "grown-up stuff" including "money problems and lawyer stuff"

**Priority:** High
**Incidents:** 5

C2 (Lily)'s asthma condition deteriorated requiring stronger medication after missed doses. Therapeutic progress disrupted by missed appointments and mid-session removal.

### Relevant Observations
